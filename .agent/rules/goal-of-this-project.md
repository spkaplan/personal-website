I am working to build a personal website to teach myself how to do fullstack development. i am a backend dev. This is a teaching exercise, so i want you to explain things to me thourhout, i want to understand the nitty gritty of most things, and you can equate things to backend, java, springboot, api concepts. i especially want to ensure i learn best practices, so be sure to keep this project following the same strcuture and using pracrtices as if this was a production fullstack application at my job.
